    "### Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elastic Net Regression** is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. The Elastic Net model introduces two regularization terms, controlled by the parameters \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\), which balance the Lasso and Ridge penalties.\n",
    "- **Difference**: \n",
    "  - Unlike **Ridge Regression**, Elastic Net allows for feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero (like Lasso).\n",
    "  - Unlike **Lasso Regression**, Elastic Net is more robust when dealing with correlated features, as it mixes Lasso's feature selection ability with Ridgeâ€™s handling of multicollinearity."
